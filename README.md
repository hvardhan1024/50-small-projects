# Welcome to My 50 Projects In 50 Days Repository

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Harshavardhan, and this is my GitHub repository for the "50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript" course by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop on Udemy.

## About This Repository

In this repository, you'll find all the awesome projects I've completed as part of the course. These projects have helped me sharpen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm excited to share them with you.

## Course Overview

The course is designed for both beginners and intermediate web developers who are looking to build fun and unique projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project is a hands-on opportunity to learn and practice essential web development concepts.

## Projects Included

Here's a list of the projects you'll find in this repository:

1. Expanding Cards
2. Progress Steps
3. Rotating Navigation Animation
   ... and many more!
